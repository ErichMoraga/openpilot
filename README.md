I've accomplished the same thing as variable steer ratio with minimal modifications and I have experienced zero lane hugging. There is a live tuner at python /data/openpilot/tune.py but I wouldn't suggest modifying the tune unless you get a few days on it and know what you are doing. The data is conclusive. Have fun.
