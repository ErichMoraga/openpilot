There are no further customizations past this at this time. I've accomplished the same thing as variable steer ratio with minimal modifications and I have experienced zero lane hugging. There is a live tuner at python /data/openpilot/tune.py but I wouldn't suggest modifying the tune unless you get a few days on it and know what you are doing. This should be all from me for INDI. The data is conclusive (see above)^^ and frankly, I'm burnt out. Have fun.
